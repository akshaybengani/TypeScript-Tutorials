# What is Data Type

A Data type represents the type of data, that can be processed by our program.
Example: numbers,characters etc.

In typescript we have built in data types and user defined types.

Built In  :- Boolean, Number, String, Void, Null, Undefined, Never

Boolean : True or false we can store yes or no true or false
Number : Here we can store any type of number it may be decimal or the whole number
String : Anything we type in the "" or '' is a string
Void : there is no type or lack of any type
Null :
Undefined :
Never :

User Defined :- array tuple enum classes etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variable :- It is a name of a memory location where we can store data
we can use two keywords "let" and "var"
example :- let name = "Akshay Bengani"

We should not use a b x y  we should use meaning full names to ur variable
